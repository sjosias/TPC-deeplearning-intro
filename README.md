Download the PACS data from [here](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=0B6x7gtvErXgfbF9CSk53UkRxVzg) and place it into a `DATA/PACS/` directory. At this directory you should have folders from the four domains. The notebooks should work from there.

The link for the data download is taken from the DomainBed [github repo](https://github.com/facebookresearch/DomainBed/blob/master/domainbed/scripts/download.py)
